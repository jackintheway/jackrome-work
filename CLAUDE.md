# jackrome-work-migration

Project-level context for Claude Code. The user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` covers working style, tone, and git discipline. This file covers only what is specific to rebuilding `jackrome.work`.

---

## Status: building

**The build started 2026-08-15 on Jack's go.** All four blocking decisions are settled and recorded below.

`INVENTORY.md` is the crawl of the live site. Read it before scoping anything. It has every URL, every embed ID, the image manifest, and eight real metadata problems on the current site.

Nothing is live. `jackrome.work` still points at Squarespace and stays there until Jack calls the cutover.

---

## What this will be

A full custom rebuild of `jackrome.work` in the Wayspace design system, replacing Squarespace. Everything in Jack's own style, made together, no platform in between.

The sibling project `../ai-work-portfolio/` is the proven pattern and the design reference. It shipped. Extend what worked there rather than inventing a second approach:

- Static HTML, CSS, vanilla JS. No React, no Tailwind, no build tooling.
- Data-driven: one array of content objects through pure render functions. Adding a page or a project means adding an object, not editing markup.
- Deployed to Netlify from GitHub, config in `netlify.toml` so settings travel with the repo.
- Self-hosted fonts, no CDN, no third-party requests.
- Tokens come from `../wayspace-design-system/`, which is the source of truth for color, type, spacing, and borders.

## Every page ships with link previews

**Any page created in this project has Open Graph tags and its own share image. This is not optional and it is not a polish-pass item.**

Most people meet a link before they meet the site, in iMessage, Slack, or LinkedIn. A page without `og:` tags shares as a bare blue URL. This was the single biggest gap found on both of Jack's existing sites, and it is cheap to get right from the start and annoying to retrofit.

Required in every page's `<head>`:

| Tag | Note |
|---|---|
| `<title>` | |
| `<meta name="description">` | Search engines. Does **not** feed link previews. |
| `<link rel="canonical">` | Absolute URL. |
| `og:type`, `og:site_name`, `og:url`, `og:title`, `og:description` | |
| `og:image` | **Absolute URL.** Relative paths silently produce no image. |
| `og:image:width` / `:height` / `:alt` | 1200 and 630. |
| `twitter:card` | Must be `summary_large_image`. Plain `summary` is a small square thumbnail. |
| `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image` | |

Rules for the image itself:

- **1200x630.** Every platform crops to this ratio.
- **Readable at 300px wide.** That is its actual size in a message thread. Type must be huge. If it only reads at full size it has failed.
- **Generated from HTML, not drawn by hand**, so it inherits the design system and stays editable. `../ai-work-portfolio/tools/og/` has the working pattern and the headless Chrome render command.
- **Its own image per page, not one shared card.** `jackrome.work` currently uses one image across nine pages, so every link previews identically. Do not repeat that.

## External links open in a new window (standing rule)

**Any link leaving `jackrome.work` opens in a new tab. Links staying on `jackrome.work` do not.**

`ai.jackrome.work` counts as leaving, for now. So does Calendly, YouTube, a client's site, and anything else off-domain. This applies to hyperlinked text and buttons alike.

Always pair `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener"`. Without it the opened page gets a handle on the page that opened it through `window.opener`, which it can use to redirect the original tab somewhere else. Modern browsers imply this, but stating it costs nothing and does not depend on the visitor's browser being current.

## Location and dates (standing rules)

- **Location is "Maryland", never "Frederick".** Applies to visible copy, meta descriptions, and share card text.
- **No year anywhere on `jackrome.work`.** No copyright line, no "2026" in the footer. A dated footer starts aging the site the moment the year turns, and it earns nothing. `ai.jackrome.work` keeps its year, because there the date is doing real work: it says how current the AI work is.

## Other standing page requirements

- Every image has real `alt` text, or `alt=""` if it is purely decorative.
- Every page works at 390px wide with no horizontal scroll.
- Visible keyboard focus states. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- No em dashes in any user-facing copy. Applies to visible text, `<title>`, and meta descriptions.
- Embeds use a facade: ship a static thumbnail, swap in the real iframe on click. No third party is contacted until the visitor asks. `/creative-portfolio` has 8 embeds and would be slow otherwise.

## Decisions (approved 2026-08-15)

The four questions that were blocking the build. All settled. Do not reopen them without Jack.

1. **Typeface: Archivo.** Same face as the AI portfolio, self-hosted, SIL Open Font License, licence text shipped beside the file. It stands in for Ballinger, which is licensed for Squarespace hosting only and cannot travel. The AI portfolio is the proof of concept for the whole site on questions like this: where it settled something, that answer carries here rather than getting relitigated.

2. **Editing workflow: same as the AI portfolio.** Edit a file, commit, push. Jack chose this knowingly and wants it as a learning surface, not just a shipping mechanism. It is additive: it does not remove his ability to use Squarespace, and he can let Squarespace go whenever he is ready. Teach as you go when a git or web pattern comes up for the first time.

3. **Orphaned pages: left in place, not migrated.** `/toolbox`, `/store`, and `/blog` stay on Squarespace and are out of scope for this build. Jack may want `/toolbox` brought over once the core site is done. See the cutover note below, because "leave them there" has an expiry date.

4. **Blog: not carrying over.** No blog in this build. If Jack starts writing at volume he would reach for Substack rather than hand-authored pages.

**Scope that follows from these:** four pages. `/`, `/about`, `/ai-enablement`, `/creative-portfolio`.

### The cutover note (deferred, not decided)

A domain is served by one host at a time. While DNS points at Squarespace, the orphaned pages keep working untouched, which is why decision 3 is free right now. The moment DNS points at Netlify, Squarespace stops answering for `jackrome.work` and `/toolbox`, `/store`, and `/blog` go with it. So each one needs a call at cutover: rebuild it, redirect it in `netlify.toml`, or let it 404 deliberately. Raise this before the DNS change, not after.

## Build order (approved 2026-08-15)

**About, then Home, then AI Enablement, then Creative Portfolio.**

About goes first because it has the strongest copy, it is a single column with no repeating content, and it proves the whole chain end to end: page shell, nav state, share image, deploy. Home and AI Enablement are the same pattern with card arrays on top. The creative portfolio is last on purpose, because it is the only one that is not a rebuild.

## Calendly is the conversion path (approved 2026-08-15)

Booking a call is the named primary conversion for the whole site, decided deliberately rather than inherited from Squarespace. Every page carries a route to it. Treat it as a real dependency: one URL, `https://calendly.com/jackintheway/chat-with-jack-rome`, kept in one place rather than hand-typed into five pages.

---

## Decisions: creative portfolio (approved 2026-08-15)

**This page is a revamp, not a rebuild.** Everything else in this project ports existing copy across. This one does not. The live page is a reference for *what creative material exists*, not for structure, order, or presentation. Do not treat `COPY.md`'s creative portfolio section as a spec to reproduce.

It gets the same care `ai.jackrome.work` got: its own thinking about what the page is for, what a visitor should feel, and how the work is framed. The live version is a grid of untitled artwork with no writing on it at all, which is the actual gap. There is a lot more available here than the current page does.

Two things have to come from Jack before it can be built: the real release list (the live page predates Feivel Speaks and RACE DAY), and what each piece of work actually is.


**Music plays through our own audio player, with a Spotify link alongside.**

Self-hosted audio in a player Jack designed, plus a plain "listen on Spotify" link per release for anyone who wants to go where the streams count. The reasoning: a Spotify embed serves a short preview to logged-out visitors, which is most portfolio visitors, inside Spotify's chrome rather than Jack's. How the music is shared is part of the portfolio, not just packaging around it.

**This breaks the AI portfolio's modal pattern, deliberately.** Over there, `closeModal()` sets `modalIframe.src = ""`, which is what keeps the modal cheap. It also kills any audio the moment a card closes. So the player does not live inside the modal:

- One `<audio>` element in a persistent bottom bar that never unmounts.
- The cover art grid is a set of remote controls. Clicking a cover tells the bar what to load, it does not open a player.
- Playing a different release swaps the source in the same bar. Playback survives navigation within the page.
- Cover art on the grid, hover state, click to enter. The card-to-shell grammar still applies to everything that is not audio.

Open before this page gets built: which tracks (not whole albums), where clean masters come from, and a check of the distribution agreement the releases went out under. Non-exclusive distribution normally leaves self-hosting fine, but confirm rather than assume.

Video embeds on this page still use the facade pattern. That rule is unchanged.

## Known facts, so they are not rediscovered

- **Squarespace has no content API.** Its developer APIs cover commerce only: orders, products, inventory, transactions. Content cannot be synced out, only moved by hand. There is no headless option.
- **URL Mappings die with the platform.** The redirect table in Squarespace does not transfer. `INVENTORY.md` has the `netlify.toml` equivalent.
- **Paths carry over one-to-one.** No redirects are strictly needed for the ten content URLs. `/home` needs a 301 to `/`, and `/cart` and `/blog/category/Toolbox` are platform-generated with no successor.
- **Export images from the Squarespace asset manager, not the CDN URLs on the page.** The page serves resized derivatives; the originals are what to keep. Rename the four placeholder-named files at export.

---

## Working rules

- Read `INVENTORY.md` and `../ai-work-portfolio/CLAUDE.md` before writing any code.
- Ask before anything hard to reverse. Interrupting with a question is cheaper than silently destroying something.
- If a plan contradicts a decision in this file, surface it. Lead with the turn, not with "no."
- Commit in small, described steps.
- Nothing goes live without Jack's explicit go. DNS cutover especially: keep the Squarespace subscription alive for a month afterward as rollback.
